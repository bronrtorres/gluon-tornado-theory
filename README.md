# Gluons as Quantum Tornadoes  
A speculative reinterpretation of strong force dynamics

## 👁 Overview  
This theory proposes that **gluons**—typically treated as massless force carriers—are better understood as **structured quantum vortex formations**, akin to tornadoes in fluid dynamics. This lens explains path selection, interference collapse, and energetic clustering with far greater physical intuition.

## 🌀 Core Idea  
A gluon behaves like a tightly wound quantum tornado—localized, self-sustaining, and fundamentally **directional**. It doesn’t travel infinitely; it **funnels** force along the path of least resistance. 

## 🔍 Why This Matters  
Current models assume infinite paths and probabilistic fog. Tornado-theory suggests that **collapse isn’t random—it’s channeled**. This affects how we understand particle behavior, interaction zones, and maybe even consciousness.

## 🚧 Status  
Published as a speculative preprint on arXiv. Seeking computational physicists, fluid modelers, and open-minded theorists for simulation and validation.
